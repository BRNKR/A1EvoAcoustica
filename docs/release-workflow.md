# ü§ñ A1 Evo Acoustica Release Workflows Guide

## **üìã Overview**

Your repository has **two smart release workflows** that automatically handle versioning, building executables, and creating GitHub releases. Here's how they work:

---

## **üîÑ Automatic Release Workflow**

### **What It Does:**

- **Triggers automatically** when you push code changes to important files
- **Detects version numbers** in your commit messages (like "v8" or "v8.5")
- **Builds executables** for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Creates GitHub releases** with smart release notes
- **Updates version numbers** in all your code files

### **How to Use It:**

#### **For Major Releases (like v8, v9):**

1. **Make your changes** locally and commit with a message like:

   ```text
   A1 Evo Acoustica v8

   - Added double bass mode
   - Improved measurements
   - Fixed bugs
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub** using Git - the workflow automatically:
   - Creates version `8.0`
   - Marks it as "latest release"
   - Builds all executables
   - Generates release notes

   **Or if you're uploading directly to GitHub:**

   1. **Upload your files** via GitHub's web interface
   2. **Use this commit message** format in the commit box:

      ```text
      A1 Evo Acoustica v8

      - Added double bass mode
      - Improved measurements
      - Fixed bugs
      ```

   3. **Click "Commit changes"** - same automatic process happens!

#### **For Silent Updates:**

1. **Make small changes** and commit normally with messages like:

   ```text
   Add files via upload
   ```

   or

   ```text
   Fix minor bug
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub** or **upload via web interface** - the workflow automatically:
   - Increments patch version (8.0 ‚Üí 8.0.1 ‚Üí 8.0.2)
   - Creates release but doesn't mark as "latest"

### **Skip Auto-Release:**

Add `[skip-release]` to your commit message to prevent automatic releases.

## **üéØ Manual Release Workflow**

### **Manual Workflow Features:**

- **Full control** over version numbers and release settings
- **Custom release notes** with markdown support
- **Platform selection** (build only what you need)
- **Dry run mode** to test before releasing
- **Smart auto-increment** when changes are detected

### **Manual Workflow Usage:**

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   - Visit your repository on GitHub
   - Click **"Actions"** tab
   - Find **"Manual Release with Custom Version"**
   - Click **"Run workflow"**

2. **Fill in the form:**

   ```text
   Version: 8.1              (or 8, or 8.1.5)
   Release Type: major       (major/minor/patch/hotfix)
   Release Notes: (optional) Custom description
   Mark as Latest: ‚úì         (yes/no)
   Platforms: all            (or specific platforms)
   Pre-release: ‚úó            (for testing versions)
   Dry Run: ‚úó                (test without releasing)
   ```

3. **Click "Run workflow"** - it will:
   - Validate your inputs
   - Show you exactly what it will create
   - Build and release according to your settings

### **Smart Auto-Increment Examples:**

- **Current: 8.1, Input: 8.1, Changes detected** ‚Üí Creates `8.1.1`
- **Current: 8.1, Input: 8, Changes detected** ‚Üí Creates `8.1.1`
- **Current: 8.1, Input: 9, Changes detected** ‚Üí Creates `9.0`

## **üìä Version Strategy**

### **Version Format:**

- **X.Y** = Major/minor releases (marked as "latest")
- **X.Y.Z** = Silent updates/patches (third digit)

### **Examples:**

```text
8.0     ‚Üê Major release (from "v8" in commit)
8.0.1   ‚Üê Silent update
8.0.2   ‚Üê Another silent update
8.1     ‚Üê Minor release (from "v8.1" in commit)
9.0     ‚Üê Next major release
```

## **üöÄ Quick Start Guide**

### **For Regular Updates (Recommended - Git Push):**

1. **Edit your files** locally (A1Evo.html, main.js, etc.)
2. **Commit with version** in message: `"A1 Evo Acoustica v8"`
3. **Push to GitHub** - automatic release happens!

### **For Regular Updates (Alternative - Web Upload):**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Upload/edit files** via web interface
3. **Use commit message**: `"A1 Evo Acoustica v8"` in the commit box
4. **Click "Commit changes"** - automatic release happens!

### **For Small Fixes (Recommended - Git Push):**

1. **Edit your files** locally
2. **Commit normally**: `"Fix bug"` or `"Add files via upload"`
3. **Push to GitHub** - patch release happens automatically

### **For Small Fixes (Alternative - Web Upload):**

1. **Upload/edit files** via GitHub web interface
2. **Use simple commit message**: `"Add files via upload"`
3. **Click "Commit changes"** - patch release happens automatically

### **For Special Releases:**

1. **Use manual workflow** from GitHub Actions
2. **Set custom version and options**
3. **Add custom release notes**
4. **Choose platforms to build**

## **üí° Pro Tips**

- **Always check the Actions tab** after pushing/uploading to see workflow progress
- **Use dry run** in manual workflow to test before releasing
- **Version detection works** with: "v8", "v8.5", "A1 Evo Acoustica v8"
- **Skip releases** by adding `[skip-release]` to commit messages
- **Major versions** (X.Y) are marked as "latest" on GitHub
- **Patch versions** (X.Y.Z) are for silent updates
- **Git push is recommended** for better version control and history
- **Web upload works great** for quick fixes when you don't have Git setup

The workflows handle all the technical details - you just focus on your code and version numbers! üéâ
